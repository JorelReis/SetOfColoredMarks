Selecting the correct colors for your webpage can greatly improve the aesthetic appeal to your readers.

I build a set of colored markers. I learn different ways to set color values and how to pair colors with each other.

I applied the colors in different ways, simply using keywords, using RGB and RGBA values, using hexadecimal strings and also using HSL and HSLA.
